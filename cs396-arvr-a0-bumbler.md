### The two readings you did:

"What is a good standard? An essay on W3C's design principles"


Getting Others Right: from the essays list


### Your 3 insights from the readings 

* Modularity: When solving a problem, it's always good to divide it into 'logical units' that can each be handled individually and assembled together to solve the main problem. This allows us to focus on one chunk and possibly use customized or even different programming language/technique in a way the doesn't interfer with other divisions of the problem. 

* Accessibility: Users of a given product can have various backgrounds we don't know about; they may have some sort of disability that makes it hard for them to utilize a webpage, for example. Thus, when designing a website or product, accessiblity issue needs to be considered in the development process. 

* Getting Others Right: This New York Times article is about how photos can be decepive and good at hiding what's going on behind the portrait we see -- "Capturing how things look fools us into thinking that weâ€™ve captured their truth." The article recommends using multiple cues like intuition and context to understand the truth behind pictures. This paper kind of relates to the accessibility point that I mentioned above. We have a limited knowledge of things we don't have control over. Thus, to arrive at the truth, we should ask or combine information from multiple sources and make the right decision. 



### Describe the visual style of your page
 

I have a simple portfolio website. It has a navigation bar and a list of assignment submission links below that. When each assignment submission link is clicked, a new collapsible area appears below that link that allows me to upload files and add description to a text area. After that I can submit it by clicking a submit button. Each of the 9 assignment links have a textarea and file upload access. I used nice colors and a background image. I like having trasparent colors so most of the colors low Alpha value.
